#### Executable file

You can generate your own executable for Windows and check the MD5SUM if you want. It is as easy as:

* Follow the instructions in the [official FAQ of 20up](http://bmenendez.github.io/20up/#Windows-dificil)
* Install [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)
* Open cmd, go to your 20up folder and execute:

    pyinstaller --onefile 20up.py
    
* Go to 'dists' folder and execute:

    FCIV -md5 20up.exe
    
This way, you should have an MD5SUM calculated for your executable file. Now you are able to check this number with the one written in [the official 20up MD5SUM file](https://github.com/bmenendez/20up/blob/master/windows/MD5SUM).
